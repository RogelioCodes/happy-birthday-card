        This was the time we ran down the mountain! We've had a lot of good
        times since then, and I'm sure we will have many more. Time and time
        again you have shown all of us that you are a friend worth keeping
        around. There's always something to learn or a laugh to be had when you
        are around.

        There we were, ninth grade touching a lock. Who knew this would turn out
        to be a long friendship. Definitely, not the lock.

        I honestly don't remember a time where you haven't been a part of my
        life. You are my brother and I can always count on you for anything and
        I hope you know that you can do the same. You've been such a positive
        influence in my life and it wouldnt be the same without you. We've had a
        lifetime of experiences and hopefully we still got a few more lifetimes
        to go. "Dont let your memes be dreams."
